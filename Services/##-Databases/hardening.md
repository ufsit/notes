# Hardening
* The admin should:
  * consistently update the db to the most current version and installing patches
  * reduce unecessary functions and services
  * remove all unused accounts, especially default ones
  * roll default paswords to secure ones
  * null any passwords not used
  * remove temp files from the db set-up precess (they sometimes can contain passwords)
  * ensure no account is used as a group account.
