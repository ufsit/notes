# Teams
* Blue: the collegiate students defending the network from the Red Team for the Green Team
* Red: industry security professionals role-playing as cyber attackers attempting to breach the network
* Green: Volunteers with a variety of skill sets, emulating typical end users
* White: infrastructure team and judges
* Orange: the C-Suite, review videos and security documentation

# Scoring
### Blue Scoring
* points are awarded for service uptime
### Red Scoring
* goal is to disrupt the CIA of the network
* Exploitability of vulnerabilities (they ask you about a vulnerability you found, how you found it, and what you would do to fix it -- be prepared to answer questions)
* points awarded upon assumed breach scenarios and penetration testing throughout the competition
### Orange Scoring
* 2 parts; submitted pre-competition
### A C-Suite Panel Brief 
* A recording sent to the C-suite, briefing them on the security posture of their infrastructure
* reflect a team's ability to brief a mock leadership panel
* [See more](./c-suite_panel_brief.md)
### Security Documentation
* the second half of orange scores
* Goal: outline the infrastructure, vulnerabilities, recommended changes and justification
* write this from the perspective that the energy company does not already have asset documentation
* must write clearly, concisely, and thoroughly
* [See more](./security_documentation.md)

### White team
* Security documentation (pre-competition, AKA during our network access phase)
* they provide templates for our documentations
* Information sharing/incident reporting
    * Throughout the day, they may ask us to provide some sort of information or reports of incidents.

### Green Scoring
* Review and complete surveys to evaluate the Blue team system's usability and user experience
* quality assurance and control
* Competitors will be provided the same directions that the Green users will be using and should validate that their website is running accurately so that all questions would be stated in a positive way
* **Recommendations**
  1. **Test**: develop user testing guides and have someone run through them to see if the website is working properly
  2. **Make Changes**: make necessary changes prior to having the website go live. If the interactions were favorable but feedback indicated another potential method for ease, check to see if that would solve an issue
  3. **Validate all security measures are followed prior to deployment**
  4. **Retest**
  5. **Validate against the Provided Test**
* Our goal is to balance the usability of our systems for customers, employees, and ourselves WHILE maintaining security of the system.
    - BAD EXAMPLE: Implementing 10 passwords in a row within 30 seconds.
    - GOOD EXAMPLE: Implementing dual authentication (2 _different_ password mechanism)

### Anomaly Scoring
* A CTF competition
* Blue Teams can complete anomalies throughout the competition
* time management challenges, DoE trivia, cybersecurity trivia, security skills
* meant to pull attention away from defending the newtork
