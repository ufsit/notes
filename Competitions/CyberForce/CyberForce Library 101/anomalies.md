# Anomalies
* CTF competition
* 1 out of 5 scored areas within the competition
* simunlate real-world, potentially time-sensitive tasks faced by professionals
* crafted challenges, mapped to the NIST NICE Framework
* Goals:
  1. expose students to real world challenge that may occur in the field

# Scoring
* Easy/trivia anomalies: one attempt
* Hard anomalies: several attempts
* Syntax is important, not case-sensitive
* watch out for special characters, as in real life, anomalies do carry special characters
