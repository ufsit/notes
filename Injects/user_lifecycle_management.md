# User Lifecycle Management
### Provisioning
Administrators will create a new account for the user, filling out the basic properties uch as name and user ID, and assigning a default password.
### User Management
All employees will be placed within an Organizational Unit (OU) that assigns accounts with the necessary permissions to their corresponding roles and departments. When onboarding an employee, the employee's manager will inform IT of what groups the employee is to be added. This ensures that users can access the resources needed for work at [Company] but cannot access anything else. If the user's role changes, then all administrators need to do is change the OU the account is in. The OUs may also be used to create distribution lists for communications within teams. 
### User Activity Monitoring
Monitoring user activity is important for evaluating the user management process and detecting security incidents. Regularly check security logs and set alerts for escalated privileges and access to sensitive data
### Deprovisioning
When an employee leaves the company, appropriate action should be taken to save any important data dn remove the account. There should be an OU that allows no access, and the account should be moved there to essentially disable it. Backup the user's files into an archive folder under a designated person in the same department to review, manage, and decide what to keep. If the account is determined to be no longer needed and the files have been reviewed, then it should be deleted.
