# Disaster Recovery Plan

**Purpose**<br>
The widespread use of computer technology and other special function equipment to support essential functions has created a need for contingency planning and disaster prevention controls. [Organization]'s dependency on information systems requires that appropriate contingency plans should be developed and maintained that will ensure the continuing of essential business functions if those systems are inaccessible for an extended period of time.<br>
The disaster recovery plan will include emergency procedures for essential business functions in the event that a company site is rendered inoperable or unusable. The plan will also include procedures for restarting essential data processing activities. 

### Definitions
* **Authorities**: Any applicable law enforcement agencies
* **Emergency**: A current or impending situation that can cause injury, loss of life, destruction of property, or interference with normal activity such that the business wite will or could be rendered partially or totally inoperable
* **Essential Business Function**: Any business function supporting an essential service required to maintain the operation of [Organization] during a data center outage or a business site outage.
* **Critical Application**: A computer application system that supports an essential business function, fitting at least one of the following criteria:
  1. Processing of the application is required for continuity of the business function in the event of a disaster
  2. If the function were handled manually, the resulting backlog of input to the application could not be recovered in a reasonable time frame after restoration of the data center, given the computer capacity available
* **Disaster**: Any event, natural or man-made, that renders a location inoperable or  unusable to the extent that in interferes with the organization's ability to provide essential service to its members
* **Disaster Recovery Plan**: A collection of plans, procedures, arrangements, and information that are completed, compiled and held in readiness for use in the event that a disaster occurs.
* **Senior Management**: C-suite members 

### Responsibilities
Senior management, the Risk Manager, and the IT department are responsible for developing, testing, and maintaining the disaster recovery plan. Management will ensure that all necessary procedures are up to date.<br>
The Risk Manager is responsible for communicating operational changes that affect contingency plans to users. Senior management will review the business site contingency plan annually. <br>
The Disaster Assessment Team (DAT), composed of members from various departments, is responsible for evaluating the severity of an emergency, disaster, or crime, determining if facilities are safe, ensuring assets are secure, and prescribing recovery procedures.<br>
The Disaster Recovery Team, composed of members of DAT, will implement the procedures in this document.

### Scope
This disaster recovery plan covers the recovery of company data processing operating systems, databases, and all other essential data processing related sub-platforms at a disaster recovery data center in the event the primary data center is rendered inoperable. It provides for the reinstatement of communications from the disaster recovery data center as well as the recovery back to the primary site once the disaster is over.<br>
The plan also provides the procedures to support the manual delivery of essential business operations during a data center outage and assistance in resuming use of the computer applications when data center processing support is restored. 

### Elements
The recovery process for a man-made or natural diaster is comprised of the same major phases:
1. **Emergency Response**: all activities and procedures to be followed when responding to an emergency
2. **Initial Damage Assessment**: analyzes the extent of the damage to the site and an estimate of the time that may be required to restore th site to normal operation. The assessment will determine whether backup processing at an alternate site should be invoked
3. **Interim Processing**: procedures are designed to support essential operations and reduce business disruption during the period when computer support is not available
4. **Restart Procedures**: steps when computer support is initially restored after an outage period
5. **Site Restoration**: includes all activities and procedures required to restore the damaged site to normal operation. 
6. **Resumption of Normal Processing**: relies on supporting procedures to provide a smooth transition from backup processing to resumption of normal activities

### Maintenance
Incomplete or outdated disaster recovery plans can result in considerable cost or possibly business failure in the event of a disaster. maintenance consists of periodic reviews, update, and testing procedures that address the backup processing strategy and the documented contingency plan procedures. This plan must be kept current in order to comply with all regulations

### Distribution
A paper copy of the Disaster Recovery Plan will be kept on site where it is easily accessible, and electronic copies will be stored locally on the workstations of senior management and DAT members ...
* In every onsite department,
* At all sites and branches, and 
* In the homes of every senior management member.

Management will ensure that each member of the DAT reads this manual upon employment and rereads it every year. The annual review of the plan is designed to bring to light any changes in procedure that will require changes in the plan, as well as to keep these plans fresh in the minds of DAT members.

### Testing
In addition to determining the feasibility of the recovery process, testing verifies the compatibility of backup resources, identifies deficiencies in procedure, generates updates in plan maintenance, and trains staff members. Testing has been categorized into the following:
1. **Checklist Testing**: determines whether accurate supplies are available for backup use, phone lists are current, resources inventories are accurate, and agreements are up-to-date. This type of testing requires the most routing exercise due to the dynamic nature of these items
2. **Simulation Testing**: requires the exercise of notification procedures, operation procedures, hardware components, and recovery operations to ensure proper performance
3. **Parallel Testing**: refers to checking records and data against past reports. This demonstrates the adequacy of training and procedures and the compatibility and capacity of backup procedures. Furthermore, it assists in determining the time requirements for performing recovery functions. 
4. **Full Interruptive Testing**: requires the substitution of contingency operations for normal methods in a live environment. This may be accomplished for a single function or as a total diaster exercise. Extreme care must be exercised to avoid precipitation of a real disaster

### Disaster Notification
In the event of a disaster that results in significant physical damage or the loss of operations for an extended period of time, then senior management will notify the appropriate authorities as promptly as conditions reasonably permit. Management will prepare a written report of the incident which describes, at minimum, the location and time of the disaster, an estimate of the loss, and actions taken in response to the disaster. Website messages can be an important tool to alert customers of a disaster.The company website server may be hosted at an offsite location through a third party service provider and may be used, if available, to notify staff and customers. Recorded phone messages may also be utilized to communicate with staff and customers if the systems required to do so are available.

### Software Failure
To safeguard against the effects of either software or hardware failure, [Organization] performs a daily backup of all critical data, and a backup of the system disk on a biweekly basis. Each backup is stored for one year, a copy onsite and a copy offsite. If computer software develops problems, the following recovery procedures will be attempted:
* Restart the system and reload a fresh copy of the software. If all tests out properly, load data files and begin processing. 
* The DRT may need to obtain the software backup stored offsite. After loading this copy, if all test out properly, load data files and begin processing. 
* The company may need to contact our software vendor and/or our emergency assistance contact to locate and correct the errors in the computer system. If all test out properly, load data files and being processing.
